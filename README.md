A sentiment analysis was conducted on the dataset, where each message was examined for its underlying sentiment. The text column was analyzed and labeled based on the sentiment it conveyed, which could be classified into three categories: 

1. Positive 
2. Negative 
3. Neutral

The text was sorted into these categories by computing the average sentiment score. Sentences with a score greater than 0 were deemed positive, those with a score less than 0 were considered negative, and those without a score were categorized as neutral statements.

# Now What?!

Having categorized the text into the three mentioned groups, I utilized Python libraries called opinion_lexicon to analyze the sentiment and then counted the positive, negative, and neutral texts using coding techniques.

# Result

The majority of texts in the dataset are associated with positive emotions, with neutral and negative sentiments following behind in that order.
